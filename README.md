# Compbuild Textures Fall Colors

Our Fall Colors addon does exactly what it says. It changes most leaves and grass colors to fall-related colors for aesthetic purposes.

### Why does this exist?

Even though there are biome-dependent leaves blocks that have fall colors, it's best meant to be used for screenshots and aesthetics rather than builds.

# How to Install

**IMPORTANT:** Before you install the addon, install the main pack first. The main pack can be found at (https://github.com/CompbuildREDUX/Compbuild-Textures).
